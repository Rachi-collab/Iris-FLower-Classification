# Iris-Flower-Classification
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Identifying species of Iris flowers manually using petal and sepal measurements can be time-consuming and prone to human error.A smart classification system is needed to help automate the process of identifying Iris flower species with high accuracy using machine learning.
PROPOSED SOLUTION
Develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on petal and sepal length and width.
The system will:
Use the popular Iris dataset
Preprocess and visualize data
Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)
Predict the species of a flower given new input data
